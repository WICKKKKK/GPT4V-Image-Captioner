### Windows (If the automatic installation fails, please refer to the [Manual Installation Instructions](#windows-manual-installation-instructions))

1. Open Command Prompt as administrator and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jiayev/GPT4V-Image-Captioner
    ```
3. Double-click `install_windows.bat` to run and install all necessary dependencies.
4. After the installation is complete, you can launch the GPT4V-Image-Captioner by double-clicking `start_windows.bat`.
5. Hold down Ctrl and click on the URL in the terminal (or copy the URL to your browser), which will open the Gradio app interface in your default browser.
6. Enter the official OpenAI or third-party GPT-4V API Key and API Url at the top of the interface. After setting the image address, you can start tagging the image.

### Linux / macOS

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jiayev/GPT4V-Image-Captioner
    ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
    ```
    cd GPT4V-Image-Captioner
    ```
4. Make the install and start scripts executable with the following command:
    ```
    chmod +x install_linux_mac.sh; chmod +x start_linux_mac.sh
    ```
5. Execute the install script:
    ```
    ./install_linux_mac.sh
    ```
6. Launch the GPT4V-Image-Captioner in the terminal by executing the launch script:
    ```

### Windows Manual Installation Instructions

1. Open the Command Prompt by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd`, and then pressing `Enter`.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jiayev/GPT4V-Image-Captioner
    ```

3. Once cloning is complete, navigate to the cloned directory:
    ```
    cd GPT4V-Image-Captioner
    ```

4. Before installing any dependencies, make sure that Python is installed on your system. Check for Python's presence by typing the following command and pressing `Enter` in the Command Prompt:
    ```
    python --version
    ```
   If Python is not installed, you will get an error message. In that case, please visit the [Python official download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions to install it.

5. Create a virtual environment named `myenv` to avoid contaminating the global Python environment:
    ```
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

6. Activate the virtual environment you just created:
    ```
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

7. Update `pip` to date:
    ```
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

8. Install libraries within the virtual environment:
    ```
    pip install scipy networkx wordcloud matplotlib Pillow tqdm gradio requests
    ```

9. After completing the steps above, you can start GPT4V-Image-Captioner by double-clicking the `start_windows.bat` file.
